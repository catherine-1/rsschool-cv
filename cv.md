### About experience

In 2019, as a freshly graduated tourism specialist I began my career as a **researcher of financial fraud on the Internet**. Despite having minimal skills in this specialized field, my passion and determination helped me build a **5-year career**. My professional experience required me to learn new things daily and quickly grasp abstract and high-tech concepts.

Gradually, I developed an interest in programming and completed a JavaScript course on Codecademy. I am drawn to Web Development because it allows to create a product while continuously learning and evolving.

I believe my unique professional background offers a distinct perspective on development, with a particular **emphasis on security**.
